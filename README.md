# Basic and Custom Keypad
<span style='color: red;'>Note: if you do not have the code for the arduino(https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-keypad)the 4X4 keypad this program will NOT run correctly</span>
 
**I(being an idiot) numbered the buttons on the matrix module from 1-16 ONLY for the user interactive input, this means that you do NOT have to modify the arduino code. because of this mistake when prompted to assign each button a keybind  BUTTON A ON THE KEYPAD IS BUTTON 4 in the code and so on for all the symbols/letters.**

to be able to run the .exe file you will first need to activate this script for the Custom Keypad
``keypad/build/CustomKeypad/CustomKeypad.exe`` and this one for the Basic Keypad ``keypad/build/BasicKeypad/BasicKeypad.exe`` once this is run  you will have a new folder called dist the exe file will be located in either ``keypad/dist/CustomKeypad`` or ``keypad/dist/BasicKeypad``.
